# MeowMaze
  To meow a maze is to solve a maze.
## Statement of Problem
  To find the boolean value to the statement:
  
  "There exists one path through a maze starting at a designated beginning that ends at the treasure".
## Personnel
  Vincent Chi, En Yu Zhang
## Recursive Abstraction
  The recursive abstraction can mark a stepping stone for backtracking.
  
## English Algorithm and/or Pseudocode.
  Base case: Traverses through a path in a single direction.
  
  - if treasure found {solved, return true}.
             
  - if no treasure here {no treasure is found, continue}.
  
  - if no treasure found at the end of path with no turn {invoke recursive abstraction}.
             
  Recursive case: If there is a split, invoke recursive abstraction. (Backtracking occurs here.)
