# MeowMaze
  To meow a maze is to solve a maze.
## Statement of Problem
  To find the boolean value to the statement:
  
  "There exists one path through a maze starting at a designated beginning that ends at the treasure".
## Personnel
  Vincent Chi, En Yu Zhang
## Recursive Abstraction
  The recursive abstraction can check for a treasure throughout a given path (or direction).
  
## English Algorithm and/or Pseudocode.
  Base case: After traversing through the entire maze,
  
  - if treasure found {solved, return true}. Snapshot(?)
             
  - else {no treasure is found, return false}.
             
  Recursive case: If there is a split, invoke recursive abstraction for each of the paths. (Backtracking occurs here.)
