# MeowMaze
  To meow a maze is to solve a maze.
## Statement of Problem
  To find the boolean value to the statement "There exists one path through a maze starting at a designated beginning that ends at the treasure".
## Personnel
  Vincent Chi

## Recursive Abstraction
  The recursive abstraction can check for a treasure throughout a given path (or direction).
  
## English algorithm and/or pseudocode.
  Base case: if treasure found {solved}. Snapshot(?)
             else {backtrack}.
  Recursive case: If there is a split, invoke recursive abstraction for each of the paths.
  
  Somehow find if maze has been thoroughly traversed for a treasure and if not then return false.
